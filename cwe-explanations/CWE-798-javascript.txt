CWE-798 addresses the security risks of embedding hard-coded credentials within software. In JavaScript applications, this can occur through practices like placing API keys directly in the source code or storing sensitive information in configuration files without proper safeguards. To mitigate these risks, developers should employ environment variables, secure storage solutions, enforce strict access controls, and conduct regular code reviews and automated scans to detect and eliminate hard-coded credentials.
