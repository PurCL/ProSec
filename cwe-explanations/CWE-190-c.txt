CWE-190 addresses vulnerabilities arising from integer overflows, where arithmetic operations exceed the maximum representable value, causing wraparounds. In C, this often manifests during memory allocation calculations or loop iterations, leading to potential buffer overflows, data corruption, or unpredictable program behavior. Developers must implement proper input validation and bounds checking to mitigate these risks.
