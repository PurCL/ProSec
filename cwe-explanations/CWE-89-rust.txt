CWE-89, SQL Injection, occurs when attackers exploit vulnerabilities in database queries to inject malicious code, potentially compromising data. In Rust, although the language's safety mechanisms help mitigate many issues, SQL injection can still happen in raw query construction without proper input sanitization or parameterization, particularly when using libraries like Diesel or SQLx. Developers should avoid embedding untrusted inputs directly into SQL queries and leverage safe query-building techniques provided by Rust's libraries.
