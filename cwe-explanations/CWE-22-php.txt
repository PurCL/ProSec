CWE-22, 'Path Traversal,' is a vulnerability where attackers can manipulate file paths to access restricted files or directories. In PHP, this typically occurs when file functions (e.g., `include`, `fopen`) use unsanitized user input. Common mistakes include allowing unchecked file paths via URL parameters, which can result in unauthorized access to sensitive files or execution of malicious code.
