CWE-78 is an OS Command Injection vulnerability that arises when untrusted input is used to build system-level commands. In Java, it typically involves methods like `Runtime.exec()` or `ProcessBuilder`, where improper input validation allows attackers to inject harmful OS commands. To mitigate, developers should avoid using external command execution with untrusted data and ensure proper input sanitization when unavoidable.
