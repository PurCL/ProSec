CWE-611 refers to the vulnerability where XML processors improperly handle external entity references, leading to potential security risks like unauthorized data access. In Java, this often occurs when XML parsers are not configured to disable external entities, allowing attackers to exploit this by including malicious entities in XML documents. Preventive measures include properly configuring XML parsers to ignore external entities and DTDs.
