CWE-590 refers to the improper deallocation of memory not allocated on the heap, leading to potential memory corruption and security risks. In C++, this typically occurs when free() is used on stack-allocated memory or when mismatched memory management routines are employed. To prevent this, ensure that only dynamically allocated memory is deallocated and that appropriate allocation and deallocation functions are consistently used.
