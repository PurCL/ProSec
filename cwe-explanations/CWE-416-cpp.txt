CWE-416 refers to the use of memory after it has been freed, leading to potential crashes, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. In C++, this typically happens due to improper handling of pointers after memory deallocation, especially in complex data structures or multithreaded applications. To prevent this, it's crucial to implement proper memory management practices, such as nullifying pointers after freeing memory and utilizing smart pointers to automate memory handling.
