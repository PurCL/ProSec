CWE-121 addresses vulnerabilities where excessive data is written to stack-allocated buffers, causing overflows that can overwrite critical memory regions. In C, this often results from using functions like strcpy without proper input length checks, leading to potential program crashes or arbitrary code execution. Mitigation involves implementing strict input validation and using safer functions that include bounds checking.
