CWE-200 is the exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized parties. In PHP, this often happens due to errors like improper error reporting (e.g., unfiltered error messages), exposure of configuration details (e.g., 'phpinfo()' output), and failure to control access to sensitive files. Developers should sanitize all outputs, configure permissions securely, and avoid exposing unnecessary information to reduce this risk.
