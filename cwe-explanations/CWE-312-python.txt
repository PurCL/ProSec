CWE-312 addresses the risks of storing sensitive data in an unencrypted form. In Python applications, this can occur through practices like logging sensitive information, storing credentials in plaintext configuration files, or setting insecure cookies. To mitigate these risks, developers should encrypt sensitive data, follow secure logging practices, use environment variables for configurations, and ensure cookies are transmitted securely.
