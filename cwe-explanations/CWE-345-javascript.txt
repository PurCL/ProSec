CWE-345 involves the failure to verify the authenticity of data, leading to the acceptance of invalid or malicious inputs. In JavaScript applications, this can occur through unvalidated external data, CSRF attacks, or improper handling of authentication tokens. To mitigate these risks, developers should implement strict data validation, employ anti-CSRF tokens, and ensure the integrity and authenticity of all data sources.
