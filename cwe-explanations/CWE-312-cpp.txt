In C++, CWE-312 occurs when sensitive information is stored in plain text files using std::ofstream or logged with std::cout. Static or global variables holding sensitive data in plain text are another common issue. This can lead to exposure through file access or memory dumps. Mitigation includes encrypting data using libraries like OpenSSL or Botan, overwriting sensitive data in memory after use, and avoiding hardcoding sensitive information into the source code.
