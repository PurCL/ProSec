CWE-680 describes a situation where an integer overflow during memory allocation calculations leads to buffer overflows. In C++, this often occurs when the product of the number of elements and their size exceeds the integer's maximum value, causing insufficient memory allocation and subsequent buffer overflows. Proper input validation and safe memory allocation practices are crucial to prevent this vulnerability.
