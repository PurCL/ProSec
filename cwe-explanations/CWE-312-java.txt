In Java, CWE-312 arises when sensitive information, such as passwords or tokens, is stored in plaintext in configuration files (e.g., application.properties), log files, or hardcoded into the codebase. This can lead to data exposure if unauthorized parties access these resources. To mitigate, use encryption libraries (e.g., JCA) to encrypt sensitive data, secure configuration files with tools like HashiCorp Vault, and avoid logging sensitive information in plaintext.
