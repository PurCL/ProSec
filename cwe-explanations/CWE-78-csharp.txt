CWE-78 relates to improper input neutralization, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands. In C#, this often happens with functions like `Process.Start()` that run external processes. Typical vulnerabilities arise from unsanitized user input being passed to these commands, leading to potential injection attacks. Proper input validation and sanitization are critical to mitigating these issues.
