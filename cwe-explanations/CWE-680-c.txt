CWE-680 addresses vulnerabilities where integer overflows during memory size calculations lead to insufficient memory allocation and subsequent buffer overflows. In C, this typically happens when calculating the size for dynamic memory allocation, such as arrays, where the multiplication of element count and size results in an overflow, causing the program to allocate less memory than required and potentially write beyond the allocated buffer.
