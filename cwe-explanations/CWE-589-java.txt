CWE-589 highlights the risks associated with using API functions that are not universally supported across all target platforms. In Java, this can occur when applications utilize version-specific or deprecated APIs, leading to potential runtime errors and reduced portability. Developers should ensure API compatibility, avoid deprecated methods, and implement version checks to mitigate these risks.
