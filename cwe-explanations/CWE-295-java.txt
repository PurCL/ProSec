CWE-295 refers to improper certificate validation, leading to potential security risks like man-in-the-middle attacks. In Java, this flaw typically occurs when developers bypass or misconfigure SSL/TLS certificate validation processes, either through insecure TrustManagers or misuse of libraries. Correct handling of SSL/TLS and up-to-date configurations are essential to mitigate this risk.
