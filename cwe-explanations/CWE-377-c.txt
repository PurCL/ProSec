CWE-377 refers to insecure creation of temporary files in directories with improper permissions, exposing the system to potential attacks. In C, this typically happens when functions like `mktemp()` or `tmpnam()` are used, or when files are created without secure flags (e.g., `O_EXCL`). These practices can lead to vulnerabilities such as race conditions or unauthorized access to sensitive data.
