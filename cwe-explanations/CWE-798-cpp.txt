CWE-798 addresses the security risks of embedding hard-coded credentials within software. In C++ applications, this can occur through practices like placing passwords or cryptographic keys directly in the source code. To mitigate these risks, developers should employ external configuration files, environment variables, secure storage solutions, prompt for user input, and conduct regular code reviews and static analysis to detect and eliminate hard-coded credentials.
