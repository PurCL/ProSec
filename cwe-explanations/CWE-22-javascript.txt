CWE-22 (Path Traversal) occurs when user inputs are not properly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the application's root directory by manipulating file paths. In JavaScript environments, especially server-side (Node.js), typical examples include API misconfigurations and file handling functions that trust user input. Proper sanitization and validation of file paths are essential to prevent such attacks.
