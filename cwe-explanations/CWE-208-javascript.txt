CWE-208 addresses vulnerabilities arising from observable timing discrepancies, where operations take varying amounts of time to complete, potentially leaking sensitive information. In JavaScript, this can occur through direct string comparisons or variable-time cryptographic operations. Mitigation involves using constant-time comparison functions, avoiding branching based on sensitive data, and utilizing established cryptographic libraries to ensure consistent execution times.
