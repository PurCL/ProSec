CWE-120 describes a vulnerability where a program copies data into a buffer without verifying the input's size, leading to potential buffer overflows. In C, this often occurs with functions like strcpy(), gets(), and scanf() using %s, which lack inherent bounds checking. To prevent such vulnerabilities, developers should use safer function alternatives and validate input lengths before performing buffer operations.
