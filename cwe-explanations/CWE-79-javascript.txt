CWE-79 addresses the issue of improper handling of untrusted input, leading to XSS vulnerabilities in web applications. In JavaScript, such issues arise when input is improperly sanitized and injected into the DOM. Common methods at risk include `innerHTML` and `eval`, which, if misused, allow attackers to inject malicious scripts. XSS attacks in JavaScript often lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or session hijacking.
