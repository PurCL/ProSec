CWE-502, 'Deserialization of Untrusted Data,' involves deserializing untrusted input, leading to potential arbitrary code execution. In Java, it occurs when mechanisms like `ObjectInputStream` handle untrusted serialized data. Common cases include deserializing data from insecure sources, making systems vulnerable to attacks. Proper validation and avoiding insecure deserialization methods mitigate this risk.
