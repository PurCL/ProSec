CWE-89 represents SQL Injection vulnerabilities, where an attacker exploits improper handling of user input in SQL queries. In Python, this typically happens when using database libraries like `sqlite3` or `mysql.connector` without properly sanitizing or parameterizing input. The most common cause is string concatenation of user data with SQL queries, exposing the application to malicious SQL commands.
