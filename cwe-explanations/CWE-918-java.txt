CWE-918, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), occurs when a server-side application makes unintended requests due to insufficient validation of user inputs used in URL construction. In Java, this can happen when user input is used to fetch data from URLs without proper validation, allowing attackers to access internal resources. Mitigation strategies include strict input validation, implementing allow-lists, disabling unnecessary protocols, and setting appropriate timeouts for outbound requests.
