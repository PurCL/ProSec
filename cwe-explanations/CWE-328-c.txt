In summary, CWE-328 highlights the risks associated with using weak hashing algorithms that fail to provide adequate security, making systems susceptible to various attacks. In C programming, this often manifests through the use of outdated functions like MD5 or SHA-1 for critical operations. Transitioning to more robust algorithms such as SHA-256 or SHA-3 is essential to ensure data integrity and security.
