CWE-908 pertains to the use of uninitialized resources, which in JavaScript can occur through variables, object properties, or function parameters that haven't been assigned initial values. Such practices can lead to unpredictable behavior, runtime errors, or security vulnerabilities. To mitigate these issues, developers should ensure that all variables and object properties are properly initialized before use, and functions are called with the appropriate arguments. Implementing strict coding practices and utilizing linters can help identify and prevent the use of uninitialized resources.
