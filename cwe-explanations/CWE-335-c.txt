CWE-335 addresses the improper management of seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs). In C, this often manifests as using predictable seeds, like the current time, or constant seeds, leading to predictable random number sequences. Such predictability can be exploited by attackers, especially in security-critical applications like cryptography. To mitigate this, it's essential to use unpredictable and unique seeds, possibly sourced from cryptographically secure random number generators or hardware-based entropy sources.
