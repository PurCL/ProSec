In summary, CWE-94 addresses the dangers of improper code generation control, leading to potential code injection attacks. In Python, this is commonly seen with the unsafe use of eval() and exec() functions processing untrusted inputs. To prevent such vulnerabilities, avoid these functions when possible, validate inputs rigorously, and use safer alternatives like ast.literal_eval() when appropriate.
