CWE-590 addresses the improper use of the free() function to deallocate memory not allocated on the heap in C programs. Common instances include attempting to free stack-allocated arrays, global or static variables, and memory allocated with alloca(). Such actions can result in undefined behavior, including program crashes and memory corruption. To prevent this, ensure that free() is only called on pointers obtained through dynamic memory allocation functions like malloc(), calloc(), or realloc().
