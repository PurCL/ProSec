CWE-676 refers to the use of inherently dangerous functions that may lead to security vulnerabilities if used improperly. In C, functions like `gets()`, `strcpy()`, and `malloc()` without proper checks are common culprits, as they can lead to buffer overflows, memory corruption, or crashes. Proper input validation and error handling are crucial to mitigate risks associated with this weakness.
