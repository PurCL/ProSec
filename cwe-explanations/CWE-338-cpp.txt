CWE-338 involves using a non-cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (PRNG), resulting in predictable outcomes and security risks. In C++, this often occurs when developers use the `rand()` function for tasks requiring security, like encryption or authentication. Secure PRNG alternatives, such as C++'s `<random>` library or external cryptographic libraries, should be used to avoid this vulnerability.
