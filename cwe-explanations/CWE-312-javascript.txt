CWE-312 in JavaScript occurs when sensitive data, like API keys or tokens, is stored in cleartext in localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies. Additionally, sensitive information logged to the browser console during debugging may also be exposed. This can result in unauthorized access if attackers access the client-side storage or code. To mitigate, avoid storing sensitive data on the client side, use HTTPS, encrypt data before storage, and implement Content Security Policies (CSP) to prevent unauthorized script execution.
