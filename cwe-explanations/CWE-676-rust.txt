CWE-676 highlights the use of potentially dangerous functions that can lead to security risks. In Rust, this occurs when unsafe code allows unchecked memory access or operations bypassing Rust's usual safety guarantees. Misuse of raw pointers and unchecked arithmetic are common examples. To avoid these risks, Rust programmers must carefully manage unsafe code blocks and external libraries.
