CWE-312 in C is commonly seen when sensitive data is stored in plain text files using functions like fprintf or left in memory without proper clearing after use. Hardcoded passwords and keys in the source code also increase the risk of exposure. To mitigate, use encryption libraries such as OpenSSL for secure storage, avoid storing sensitive data in plain text, and overwrite sensitive data in memory after it is no longer needed to prevent leaks.
