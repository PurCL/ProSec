CWE-319 pertains to the transmission of sensitive data in cleartext, which can be intercepted by unauthorized actors. In JavaScript applications, this often occurs when data is sent over unsecured channels, such as HTTP or unencrypted WebSocket connections. To mitigate this risk, developers should enforce HTTPS, use secure WebSocket connections, implement strict Content Security Policies, and ensure proper input validation and output encoding.
