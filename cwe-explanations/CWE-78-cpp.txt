CWE-78 refers to OS Command Injection, a vulnerability where untrusted input is used in OS commands without proper sanitization, leading to the execution of arbitrary commands. In C++, this often arises from unsafe usage of system calls like 'system()' or 'popen()' that execute shell commands using external input. Improper handling of input in these functions can lead to serious security risks.
