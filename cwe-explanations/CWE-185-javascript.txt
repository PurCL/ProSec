CWE-185 pertains to incorrect regular expressions that improperly match or compare data, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. In JavaScript, this can occur through unanchored expressions, overly permissive patterns, or complex expressions susceptible to ReDoS attacks. Mitigation involves anchoring patterns, defining specific patterns, avoiding vulnerable constructs, and utilizing built-in validation functions.
