CWE-352 is the Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability, where attackers exploit a user's authenticated session to execute unauthorized actions. In Java web apps, this often stems from missing or inadequate CSRF protection, such as not using or improperly validating anti-CSRF tokens in forms. Java frameworks like Spring or Struts are particularly prone to these issues when CSRF defenses are not fully implemented.
