CWE-942, "Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains," occurs when an application implements an overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy, allowing access from untrusted domains. This can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or malicious actions.

In Java, this often arises in frameworks like Spring Boot when the @CrossOrigin annotation is used without restricting origins, or when wildcards (*) are included in CORS policies. For example, using @CrossOrigin without specifying trusted domains allows access from any domain, exposing the application to potential exploitation.
