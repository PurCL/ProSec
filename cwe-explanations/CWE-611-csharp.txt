CWE-611 involves improper handling of XML External Entities (XXE), leading to potential attacks like data theft, DoS, or RCE. In C#, it often happens when developers misuse XML parsers by leaving external entity resolution enabled, especially when processing untrusted inputs. Safe practices include setting `XmlResolver` to null and using secure configurations like `DtdProcessing = Prohibit`.
