CWE-327, "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm," highlights the dangers of using outdated or insecure algorithms in Java, such as MD5, SHA-1, or DES. These algorithms are vulnerable to attacks, including collisions and brute force. Common examples include using MD5 for hashing or DES for encryption, both of which compromise security.

To mitigate these risks, developers should replace weak algorithms with secure ones like SHA-256 for hashing and AES for encryption. Additionally, cryptographic practices must include secure random number generators for IVs and salts, such as `SecureRandom`. Staying updated with current cryptographic standards ensures applications remain robust against modern threats.
