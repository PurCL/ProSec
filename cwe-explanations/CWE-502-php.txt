CWE-502 addresses vulnerabilities in deserializing untrusted data, which can lead to code injection or system exploitation. In PHP, this is often seen when the `unserialize()` function is applied to untrusted input, allowing attackers to manipulate application behavior or execute malicious actions. Proper validation and sanitization of serialized data are crucial to mitigate these risks.
