CWE-352 represents Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), where attackers can trick users into executing unintended actions in a web application. In C# and ASP.NET, these vulnerabilities are often seen when anti-CSRF tokens are not implemented. Developers must ensure that every state-changing request is protected using tokens like 'AntiForgeryToken' to prevent exploitation and maintain secure sessions.
