CWE-798 addresses the security risks of embedding hard-coded credentials within software. In Python applications, this can occur through practices like placing passwords or API keys directly in the source code. To mitigate these risks, developers should employ environment variables, secure configuration files, secrets management services, and conduct regular code reviews and static analysis to detect and eliminate hard-coded credentials.
